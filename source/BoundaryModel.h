//  This encapsulates all of the information for representing a wall. Since wall never
//  move, we normally would not need a separate class (because we could just use an instance
//  of PolygonObstacle).  However, this changes when we do dynamic level loading.
//
//  The problem is that we need to initialize an physics object when a level is loaded,
//  but NOT attach any assets yet.  That is because the physics object is itself an asset
//  and it is not safe to assume the order of asset loading.  So instead, we just store
//  the keys of the assets in this class, and they attach the assets later when we
//  initialize the scene graph.
